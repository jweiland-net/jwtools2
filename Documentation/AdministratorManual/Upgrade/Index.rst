Upgrade
=======

If you upgrade EXT:jwtools2 to a newer version, please read this section
carefully!

Upgrade to Version 7.0.0
========================

..  important::

    This version is not TYPO3 11 compatible!

Removed Option: `typo3UploadFieldsInTopOfEB`
--------------------------------------------

The `typo3UploadFieldsInTopOfEB` option has been removed from TYPO3 before 6.2
version. This change was necessitated by the introduction of a paginator in File
Abstraction Layer (FAL). As a result, it's no longer possible to adjust the
position of File upload or create fields above the list without Xclass.

Compatibility Fixes and Updates
-------------------------------

*   Compatibility fix for TYPO3 12
*   Testing Framework migrated to TYPO3 Testing Framework

Deprecated and Obsolete Features
--------------------------------

*   Remove support for TYPO3 11 and lower versions
*   Removed `jwtools2:executeExtensionUpdate` command line controller as it is obsolete.
*   Removed deprecated functions and usages
