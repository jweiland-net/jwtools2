      <trans-unit id="typo3TransferTypoScriptCurrent" approved="yes">
        <source>Transfer TypoScript current: For each record, found by CONTENT, renderObj
          will create a new instance of ContentObjectRenderer. The data property will be filled with the values of the record. The TypoScript
          current value will be resetted. Activate this option if you want to transfer the parent current value into the
          subproperty of renderObj.

      <trans-unit id="typo3RequiredColumnsForFiles" approved="yes">
        <source>Required columns for image files: Enter here columns of the DB tables sys_file and/or sys_file_metadata

      <trans-unit id="typo3ExcludeVideoFilesFromFalFilter" approved="yes">
        <source>Exclude hidden video files: If you work with video files, TYPO3 creates .youtube and/or .vimeo files. If
          a title could not be fetched, a file like ".youtube" will be created which is handled as hidden file. Instead
          of showing all hidden files, you can activate this option, to only show these two hidden video types in
          filelist.

      <trans-unit id="reduceCategoriesToPageTree" approved="yes">
        <source>Reduce categories to a page tree: In case of a multi-domain TYPO3 instance it makes sense to reduce
          categories in a category-tree to PIDs of the current page-tree. So, after activating this checkbox, you will not see
          any categories of foreign page-trees anymore. Admin user will still see everything.
